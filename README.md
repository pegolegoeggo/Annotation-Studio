# Annotation Studio
An annotation platform designed for teaching and learning in the humanities,
and with aspirations to more general use.

## Works with: MIT Annotation Data Store
There are two servers required to run this application. This one, and the [MIT
Annotation Data Store](https://github.com/hyperstudio/MIT-Annotation-Data-Store
).

You __MUST__ get the Annotation server running to be able to create or view
annotations.

# Getting Started

## Things to install
Annotation Studio uses PostgreSQL

The MIT Annotation Data Store requires Node.js (0.10.21), NPM (1.3.11) and
MongoDB

## General Installation
Set up Rails (if you haven't yet, try: [thoughtbot's Laptop repo]
(https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop))

- ```git clone git@github.com:hyperstudio/Annotation-Studio.git
annotation-studio```
- ```cd annotation-studio```
- ```./bin/setup```

which will:

* Drop existing databases
* Run migrations and prepare the test database
* Seed the application
* Install the MIT Annotation Data Store under `./tmp/annotation_data_store`
* Create an example application.yml

After setting up the app, run:

```bash
bundle exec foreman start -f Procfile.dev
```

to spin up development dependencies. You can exist the development daemons by
hitting ctrl-c, per normal unix semantics.

### Installation on Heroku
If you would like to run the application on Heroku (recommended), do the
following

- Create a Heroku app `heroku apps:create $APPNAME`
- Add the Heroku PostgreSQL add-on `heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql`
  - Don't worry about providing db configuration, [Heroku will do it for you]
(https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#connecting-in-rails)
- Use Figaro to load your `application.yml` into environment variables and
communicate them to Heroku
  -  `rake figaro:heroku[$APPNAME]`

### Multitenancy
This app uses the [apartment gem](http://github.com/influitive/apartment) to allow multiple domains to be hosted in a single instance.  

To create a new tenant:

1. Log in via an AdminUser account to http://www.your-app-url.com/admin/
1. Add a Tenant record, with the full hostname at which you want users to access the application, and the name of the database to be used to store the tenant's data
1. Configure DNS for that domain (or subdomain), pointing it to the URL of the application
1. Add the domain in question to the web server configuration for the application

#### Caveats
1. If a domain does not have a matching Tenant, the default "public" tenant will be used.
2. Admin users are shared across all tenants, and therefore shouldn't be created and granted to single-tenant users
